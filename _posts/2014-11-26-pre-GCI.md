Google Code-in will start in 5 days. As always I have set my hopes high and more precisely on the grand prize, a paid trip to Mountain View, California. Knowing me, and most people, the high you get from such visions of greatness unfortunately fades off rather quickly. You tell yourself you'll do all the work well and properly but that doesn't always work out. A good example of this is returning to school after a term break or a summer, set on doing better then before and after a few weeks returning to the old ways. I think everybody has had a similar same experience in their lives.

## How do I plan to combat this?
I have some plans and will see how that'll work out, the plans are similar to tips usually given to procrastinators.
### Think of what I'll accomplish, 
what a high that'll be and what an achievement for me. Take some of that from the future to power the present day. Since some mentoring organizations are taking part in this program for the very first time so if someone is chosen as a Grand Finalist might go into history.
### It's the journey that counts.
Although it's cliche to say it (and is it cliche to say it's cliche?) we humans are bad at delayed gratification, so bad that whole industry's have evolved to capitalize on it (e.g. games, fashion). A constant drive that is pushed by the community/software/challenges will contribute little steps towards the final goal.

## Future Plans
As of writing this, I plan on contributing to [OpenMRS.][OpenMRS Link] I never thought about free medical software also I've never encountered open source projects with such breadth, of course my world of open source before this were Objective-C trending repo's on Github, small libraries with specific usage. However, I don't want to set anything in stone so I'll wait until 1st of December and see what tasks they and others set.
